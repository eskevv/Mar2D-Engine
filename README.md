# Mar2D-Engine (uncontinued)
2D game engine using C++ and SDL2
### I plan on coming back and remaking this from scratch with more game engine experience 

#LIBS USED
  -- SDL2 for multi platform support window creation and event handling
  -- sol for lua scripting support (not fully implemented yet)
  -- imgui a simple optimal GUI lib
  
#WORKS:
  -- event dispatcher
  -- animations
  -- game loop / time system with SDL ticks
  -- texture loading
  -- game class interface
  -- basic circle / square collisions and pixel collisions
  -- FPS capping
 
#TODO:
  -- particle system
  -- animation state machine
  -- possible ECS architecture
  -- virtual methods for interface abstraction
  -- physics components
  -- Lua support
  -- Level loader with lua 
  -- GUI
  -- audio
